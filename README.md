# backpack
built to serve developers, connecting the next billion


It can help us connect the whole of Africa, achieve economic freedom, and with this realisation we decided to build backpack,
a modern day developer swiss knife, one that would help them build solutions to the problems we face as humans

A collection of the worlds greatest hits bundled into a low code solution,
providing the flexibility needed to achieve our mission
